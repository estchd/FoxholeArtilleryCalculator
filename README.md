# FoxholeArtilleryCalculator
A Artillery Calculator for the Foxhole Game

This Calculator will assist you in accuratly guiding Artillery Barages in Foxhole.

## Reason

Guiding Artillery Barrages can be a challenging endeavour even if you are a skilled Player.
Without a calculator, you have to guess Heading and Distance Information if you cannot see the Enemy from your Artillery Encampment which runs you at extreme risk of friendly fire.
Existing Calculators can fill this gap as long as you can see both the Enemy and your Artillery Encampment at the same time but as soon as you advance forward and cannot see your Encampment anymore, you are back at guessing.

This is where this Calculator comes into play. It enables you to designate recognizable Spots as "Hops" on which you can base your Guidance, enabling you to Advance as far as you want while still accuratly guiding Barrages.

## Usage

Using the Calculator is fairly Simple.

As long as you can see both the enemy and the Artillery gun at the same time, you punch in the Heading and Distance for both into the respective Fields and get the Total Heading from your Gun to the Enemy in the "Calculated Tasking" Fields.

When you need to advance further, you first need to pick a easily recognizable spot. This spot will be a "Hop" for the Calculation.
Add a new Hop with the "Add Hop" Button.
Now put in the Heading and Distance from said hop to your gun position in the "Last Hop to Gun" Field.

After this, you put the Heading and Distance from your position to the Hop into the "First Hop to Spotter" Field and you are all set to guide a new Barrage.
